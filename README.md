# About
This repository contains the classes needed for solving PSE WS 22/23 excercise sheet 11.

The sheet has a presence and a homework part.

In the presence part you learn how to test your code using JUnit.
In the homework part you translate a UML class diagram into code.

The coding exercises in the presence part should be solved in the specific given classes.
For the homework part you need to create your own classes and package (the naming is described on the exercise sheet).
